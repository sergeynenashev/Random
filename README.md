# Random

This is my pet project dedicated to random universe modeling. 
The goal of the project is to create and model random universes with random laws of physics. 

Any universe in the project consists of a space and a set of laws developing it in time. I'm going to:
* randomize a space 
* randomize laws
* simulate number of universes cutting non developing ones
* run new universes instead of the cut ones
* visualize multidimensional universes 
* find way to create interesting universes
